## Objectives

In this step, we will start to use the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager to install and manage dependencies for our project.

## Implementation

Using a shell, we first navigate into this directory.
Next, we initiate a new project with the following command.

```bash
npm init
```

This generates the `package.json` that you can see in the directory. Note that we do not have a `package-lock.json` file yet as we have not installed any packages using NPM.

For more information on this, watch [our YouTube tutorial on NPM](https://youtu.be/2nFO0E6q-1o?t=570).

Also, [visit this compare page](https://github.com/portsoc/hangman-in-branches/compare/1...2?diff=split) to see all the differences between branches 1 and 2.

## Usage

The file `hangman.js` is unchanged from the previous branch so after running the following command, you will be getting the same output:

```
node hangman.js
```

## Further Exploration

Can you work out our answers for the questions the `npm init` command asks us?
Use this as a template for your own projects.
