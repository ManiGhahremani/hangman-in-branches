## Objectives

Our website needs a homepage.
So our first task is to create a simple HTML page.

All we care about at this stage is to have placeholders for different components of our game.
Therefore the **style of the page** is not important at the moment.



## Implementation

We have created a simple HTML page, titled `index.html`.

Here, we have set standard metadata such as the title, character set and viewport of the page.
We have also added placeholders for the canvas and two more for different parts of the page.

Additionally, we have linked our JS file to this page and as a result, have renamed `hangman.js` to `index.js` (a more conventional name for a JavaScript file).

Also, [visit this compare page](https://github.com/portsoc/hangman-in-branches/compare/2...3?diff=split) to see all the differences between branches 2 and 3.

## Usage

The file `hangman.js` is unchanged from the previous branch so after running the following command, you will be getting the same output:

```
node hangman.js
```

## Further Exploration

Can you work out our answers for the questions the `npm init` command asks us?
Use this as a template for your own projects.
