## Objectives

Let's begin by storing the words for the game and then test how we can select them.

## Implementation

We have begun by creating the script `hangman.js` to hold the game's logic.

In there, we have defined an array of strings called `words` which contains movie titles.

## Usage

Navigate to the `hangman` folder in a shell or open a new terminal in your editor (in Visual Studio Code, the shortcut is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>'</kbd> on Linux/Windows and <kbd>^</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> for Mac).

In the shell, run the following command:

```
node hangman.js
```

This runs the `hangman.js` script which selects two elements from `words` and prints them back to you.
