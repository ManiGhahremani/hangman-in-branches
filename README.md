# Hangman In Branches

In this repo, we will build a hangman game in stages.
Each stage is placed in a different branch.

## Requirements

If you are using University computers, get git and optionally GitHub Desktop from AppsAnywhere.

If you are using Replit, import this repository into a new Node Repl.

Otherwise, on your computers, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), the [GitHub client](https://github.com/cli/cli) or the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app.

## Clone

1. Using `git`:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/manighahrmani/kitten.git
   ```

2. Using GitHub CLI tool:

   ```shell
   gh repo clone manighahrmani/kitten
   ```

3. Using the GitHub Desktop app:

   While viewing the repository in your browser, click the "Code" button and select Open with GitHub Desktop.

## Select the branch

As we build the game, we will switch between branches.

The branch for the first stage is `0`.
To access the code for any other branch, you must switch the current branch.

Follow the instructions below to switch your branch (where x is a number):

1. Using `git` in the shell:

   ```shell
   git checkout x
   ```

2. If you are using the GitHub Desktop client, follow this [instruction on how to switch branches on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#switching-between-branches)

## Run

Open the shell and run the following command:

   ```shell
   node hangman.js
   ```

Remember to view the source code in the editor.
