# Branch 0: Storing data in variables

## Objectives

Let's begin by storing the words for the game and then test how we can select them.

## Implementation

We have begun by creating `hangman.js` to hold the game's logic.

In there, we have defined an array of strings called `words` which contains movie titles.

## Usage

Navigate to the `hangman` folder in a shell or open a new terminal in your editor and run the following command:

```
node hangman.js
```

This runs the `hangman.js` script which selects two elements from `words` and prints them in the console.
