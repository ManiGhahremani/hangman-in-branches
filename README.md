# Hangman In Branches

## Branch 0

In this branch, we are creating a JS script, `hangman.js`, which holds the game logic.
We first create an array of words (in our case movie names) called `words`.
We then create two functions `randomNumber` and `randomWord`.
Using these functions we can then select a random word from the list.
