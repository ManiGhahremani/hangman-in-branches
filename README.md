## Objectives

Our aim in this branch is to move some of the functionality from our `client` folder to the `server` one.
Our web server should be able to handle requests from the client and return the appropriate response.
Additionally, we will be using fetch so that our client can request smaller and more manageable pieces of data from the server.

If you have not already done so, visit the module resources on the topic and be sure to work your way through the examples and tests of the [fetch101 repository](https://github.com/portsoc/fetch101).
We also recommend you view the [staged-simple-messageboard](https://github.com/portsoc/staged-simple-message-board)[ repository](https://github.com/portsoc/staged-simple-message-board).

## Implementation

To see the new changes, head to [this compare page](https://github.com/portsoc/hangman-in-branches/compare/7...8?diff=split).

## Usage

Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next, run the start script to start the server:

```
npm start
```

The website is now running locally on port 8080 so view it by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
Stop the server with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the shell.

## Todo

We have met all of the goals we have set previously.
So it is time to set out new goals for ourselves.
